# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

## My personal solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges for 2024

***May contain spoilers for the current day of Advent of Code.***

My solutions written in Python. These are made to work specifically with the format of the inputs for the challenge, but I cannot share my specific inputs or solutions. I might update these later to work with any length input. This repository started on December 3rd instead of 1st because I previously accidentally included my inputs. I deleted the old version because those inputs were still accessible through the history.

# Notes

Specific notes about the puzzles after I've solved them.

- Day 4 part 2 took me 8 tries because I missed the fact the pattern could be rotated 90°, earlier in the instructions it looked like it had to be 180°.

# Update

As of day 6, have decided to stop doing the challenges. I don't currently have the time to dedicate to solving them. I will continue to use this repo for future years' challenges, if I decide to do them.
